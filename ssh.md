## What is SSH?
We can think of **SSH** as a secret tunnel that lets us talk safely to another computer far away.

It is a secure, encrypted way to remotely access systems using cryptographic keys instead of passwords.

**SSH** (**Secure Shell**) is a secure network protocol used to:
*	Log in to a remote system-**ssh user@server**
*	Run commands on it
*	Transfer files securely- **scp path/to/localfile.txt user@remote_ip:/path/to/destination/new_filename** to copy a file from your computer to the remote server, **scp user@remote_ip:/path/to/file.txt./localfolder/**  to copy a file from remote to local, **rsync -av file user@server:/path** to sync files/folders efficiently, only transferring differences(-a → archive (keep permissions, timestamps, symbolic links, etc.), -v → verbose (see what’s happening)) etc.
*	Forward ports- **ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 user@server**
*	Run git(github, gitlab..)- **git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git**
  
…etc.

It replaces insecure methods like Telnet and FTP, which are like sending postcards — anyone can read them whereas SSH is like sending a locked, tamper-proof box — only the person with the key can open it.

Default port: **22**

Security: Encryption + authentication
## Why do we need SSH?
#### Without SSH:
*	Passwords travel as plain text 
*	Anyone sniffing the network can steal credentials 
#### With SSH:
*	All data is encrypted
*	Identity of server & client is verified
*	Extremely hard to intercept or tamper with
## How SSH Works?
SSH uses three main ideas:
1.	Encryption – protects data
2.	Authentication – verifies identity
3.	Integrity – ensures data isn’t altered

SSH Connection Flow (Step-by-Step)

1)	***Client → Server Connection***

You run: ssh user@server_ip

Your computer = SSH client

Remote machine = SSH server

2)	***Server Authentication (Host Verification)***
*	Server sends its public host key
*	Client checks: “Have I seen this server before?” (the public keys of the connected servers are stored in:  **~/.ssh/known_hosts**)

If new, the computer asks: Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? (the client hasn’t seen the server before, so it asks the client if it’s sure that the server is safe and that it actually wants to connect to that server)

This prevents Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks

3)	***Key Exchange & Encryption Setup***

SSH uses:
*	**Asymmetric encryption** like RSA/ Ed25519 / ECDSA uses 2 keys- **public** (which anyone can know) and **private** (which is secret, only you have it); **If data is encrypted with public key, only private key can decrypt it** or **if encrypted with private key, only public key can decrypt**. It’s **safer**, no need to share the private key. However, it’s **slower** than symmetric encryption.
*	**Symmetric session key** (**same key is used to lock and unlock the data**; Both sender and receiver must have the same key) - faster for data transfer
  
  In SSH, during initial connection, asymmetric encryption is used to:
*	Verify the server
*	Exchange a secure session key

 	and symmetric encryption is used to use that session key to quickly encrypt all commands/files.
 	
After this:
*	All communication is encrypted
*	Even SSH passwords are encrypted

4)	***User Authentication***

Two main methods:

A. **Password Authentication**
*	Server asks for password
*	Password is encrypted
*	Less secure

B. **SSH Key Authentication** (BEST PRACTICE)
*	Uses public-private key pair
*	No password sent over network

**FULL END-TO-END EXAMPLE** (Story Form)

Situation:
*	Your  laptop → Client
*	Your friend’s Linux PC → Server
*	Username on server = jitha
*	Server IP = 192.168.1.10

**Note** : all ssh commands are typed in the Terminal

1️⃣ **Generate SSH keys** (On your laptop):

Syntax: **ssh-keygen -t ed25519**      
* if we don’t mention '-t ed25519', the system chooses a default, usually RSA(older) which creates bigger keys, it still works but it’s not the best practice. **ed25519** is recommended as it’s **modern, fast and very secure**; it creates **smaller keys**
* In case of **symmetric keys**, **bigger keys will be exponentially harder to crack** and **smaller ones will be easier to brute-force**. In case of **asymmetric keys**, **bigger keys will be stronger but slower**. However, **ed25519 is smaller in bits but extremely strong, because it uses a better math algorithm than old RSA**.

Using the syntax, keys are created locally. 

**Private key** will be stored in **~/.ssh/id_ed25519** and **public key** in **~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub**

2️⃣ **Copy public key to remote computer** :

Syntax: **ssh-copy-id <user>@<remote_ip_or_hostname>**
Ex: ssh-copy-id jitha@192.168.1.10

Public key goes to server; public key is added to: **~/.ssh/authorized_keys**

3️⃣ Login: 

Syntax: **ssh <user>@<remote_ip_or_hostname>**

Ex: ssh jitha@192.168.1.10

## How SSH Key Authentication Works?
*	Client proves it owns the private key
*	Server checks it against the public key
*	If they match → access granted 

Private key never leaves our system; Login happens WITHOUT password

## WHERE everything lives?
|Item|	Location|
|-----|-----|
|Private key|	**Client**:  ~/.ssh/id_ed25519|
|Public key|	**Client**:  ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub|
|Authorized public keys|	**Server**:  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys|
|Known servers|	**Client**:  ~/.ssh/known_hosts|

All these keys are present in the **ssh directory** 

* Generate keys locally → copy public key to server → login using private key.

## What Are SSH Keys?
**SSH keys** are cryptographic keys used to authenticate securely. They come in pairs:
|Key Type|	Purpose|
|-----|-----|
|Private Key|	Stays with YOU (secret)|
|Public Key|	Shared with the server|

## How Are SSH Keys Secured?
1. **File Permissions**
*	**Private key**: **600**
*	**.ssh directory**: **700**

Linux has 3 types of users:
1.	Owner (you)
2.	Group
3.	Others (everyone else)

And 3 permissions:
*	Read (r) = 4
*	Write (w) = 2
*	Execute (x) = 1

The numbers are just addition of these

* **chmod** is a command used to set who can read, write, or use a file or folder in Linux.
  
**.ssh directory → 700**

Syntax: chmod 700 ~/.ssh

What 700 means:
|Who|	Permission|	Meaning|
|----|-----|-----|
|Owner|	7 (4+2+1)|	Can read, write, enter|
|Group|	0|	No access|
|Others|	0|	No access|

Effect:
*	Only YOU can enter .ssh
*	No one else can even see file names
*	Prevents others from browsing or copying keys

 **Private key file → 600**
 
Suntax: chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

What 600 means:
|Who|	Permission|	Meaning|
|-----|----|-----|
|Owner|	6 (4+2)|	Can read & write|
|Group|	0|	No access|
|Others|	0|	No access|

Effect:
*	Only YOU can read the private key
*	No one else on the system can copy or use it
  
* SSH refuses to use a private key if permissions are too open(this is intentional security)

2. **Passphrase** (Optional but Recommended)- it’s like a password to open (decrypt) the private key file

while storing the generated keys, we'll be asked to enter a passphrase

to change passphrase, use -p: **ssh-keygen -p**

to specify passphrase of which key file you want to change, use -f<file>: **ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519**

Even if key is stolen → attacker needs passphrase

When you run ssh-keygen -p, you are:
*	Adding (or changing) a passphrase
*	This encrypts your private key file itself

        Without passphrase (danger case), the private key file will be in plain form
        If attacker gets your private key file:
        * They can use it immediately
        * No extra protection


        With passphrase (safe case)
        Private key file is stored as encrypted private key
        To use it:
        1.	SSH asks for passphrase
        2.	Passphrase decrypts private key in memory(RAM)
        3.	Key is used →login→ then memory is cleared
        If attacker steals the file:
        * They still need the passphrase
        * File alone is useless

3. **SSH Agent** (Key Manager)

**eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"** - starts the agent and sets environment variables for your shell → ready to use 

**ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519** – to add key

*	Holds decrypted keys in memory
*	You type passphrase once
*	Safer than storing plain keys

**Session** = active login time (your terminal login)

SSH treats each command/program(ssh, scp, git push etc) as a separate process, even in the same terminal/session

Within the same session, with passphrase+no agent, passphrase is asked while starting each command/program and once we exit the program, the RAM is cleared. On the other hand, What exactly is ssh-agent tied to?

When ssh-agent runs, it creates a private socket like this: /tmp/ssh-XXXXXX/agent.YYYY

And sets an environment variable: SSH_AUTH_SOCK

This socket:
*	Belongs to your user
*	Has file permissions
*	Is accessible only inside your session

A **socket** is a private pipe for communication b/w programs

An **environment variable** is a dynamic, named value that stores configuration data like file paths or API keys, accessible by the OS and running applications to influence their behaviour and settings without code changes. 

**Who can use your ssh-agent?**

✅ Can use it:
*	YOU
*	Programs you start
*	SSH commands from your terminal
*	Forwarded sessions you explicitly allow

❌ CANNOT use it:
*	Other users on the same machine
*	Someone logged in as another account
*	Someone on the network
*	Someone after you log out

**Why attacker can’t use your agent?**

Socket has permissions like: **srw------- jitha jitha**

Meaning:

s = socket

rw------- = read & write for owner only, nobody else

jitha (first one) → owner of the file; This is the user who can read/write the socket

jitha (second one) → group of the file; Every user in this group would also have access if permissions allowed, but here rw------- only allows owner

**When you logout**:
*	Session ends
*	Environment variables gone
*	ssh-agent process stops
*	Socket disappears
*	RAM cleared
+ No key left anywhere ❌

**Why attacker can’t “come later”?**

For attacker to use your agent, they must:
*	Be logged in as you
*	OR control your session

At that point :

System already trusts them as YOU

SSH agent does NOT authenticate users.

The operating system does.

If attacker can use your agent: They are already authenticated as YOU

SSH agent doesn’t weaken security — it assumes OS security.

Because if attacker can:
*	Run commands as you
*	Access your session
*	Access your RAM

Then they can already:
*	Read browser cookies
*	Steal passwords
*	Install malware
*	Do FAR worse than SSH

**Why SSH agent is still safe in real world?**

Protection layers:
*	Agent socket permissions
*	User isolation
*	Session isolation
*	Optional time limits (Example: ssh-add -t 30m => After 30 minutes: Agent forgets key; Even YOU need passphrase again)

4. **Hardware Security** (Advanced) - Instead of storing your private key on disk or in RAM, the key is stored inside a physical device.
* YubiKey
* TPM
* Smart cards

Private key never leaves hardware

## Logout completely and securely
*	Close remote SSH session:
**exit**  OR  **logout**
*	Stop ssh-agent (optional, extra safe):
**ssh-agent -k**

## Common SSH Attacks & Defenses
|Attack|	Defense|
|-----|-----|
|Brute-force login|	Disable passwords|
|MITM|	known_hosts check|
|Key theft|	Passphrase + permissions|
|Weak keys|	Use Ed25519|
